## Admin: Add Users to Cognito

The script [create_user.py](backend/task-manager-backend/create_user.py) allows an administrator to create a new user in the AWS Cognito User Pool, assign a temporary password, and add the user to a specified group (e.g., Admin, User, etc.). This setup enables the user to sign in via the frontend application and forces them to change their password to a permanent one on first login, improving security.

---
### Usage
- Make sure you have a `.env file` in the root of the project with the following variables set:
    ```
    USER_POOL_ID=your_cognito_user_pool_id
    USERNAME=user@example.com
    PASSWORD=TemporaryPassword123!
    GROUP_NAME=User  # or Admin

    ```

- Run the script

    ```
    python scripts/create_user.py

    ```

- On success, you will see a confirmation:

    ```
    User user@example.com created with temporary password and added to User.
    User user@example.com will be required to change password on first login.

    ```
---

### What happens on first login?

- When the user logs in for the first time using the temporary password, AWS Cognito triggers the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge.
- The frontend detects this challenge and redirects the user to a Set New Password form.
- The user enters their new permanent password in this form.
- Upon successful password update, the user can then log in normally with the new password.

---
### Notes

- The script creates users with a temporary password, not a permanent one.
- The frontend is responsible for handling the `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge flow to force the password update.
- This approach improves security by ensuring users set their own permanent passwords.
- The MessageAction='SUPPRESS' prevents Cognito from sending a welcome email.

---
## Future Enhancements

- Email notifications via Amazon SES
- Task history logs
- PWA capabilities
